1. Preface
----------

The Raspberry OS bases on LINUX, so
the installation is simular to
the HWGUI installation on LINUX.


2. Installation of prerequisites
--------------------------------

This chapter describes the installation of:
- The OS
- GCC
- GTK2
- wmctrl

First after switching the Raspberry Pi on,
follow the installation steps
in the Raspberry Pi desktop.
(Set language, set password of main user, 
connect to LAN/WLAN, download and run first updates, final reboot )

You need to enter a main userid (administrator role)
and an associated password. For example (in my case)
it is "afu".

Terminal:
Open a terminal window on your Raspberry Pi
(you can do this by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T)
and run the commands.


Now start the full upgrade:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get update

This takes some time.


Install the developer environment:
sudo apt install build-essential -y

If not already installed (for example Pi 5 und up):
sudo apt install libpcre3 libpcre3-dev


Check the GCC by typing:
gcc --version
gcc (Rasbian 10.2.1-6+rpi1) 10.2.1 20210110 

nano hello.cpp

#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
  return 0;
}

Save and exit the editor (in nano, press Ctrl+X, then Y to save and Enter to confirm the filename). Now compile the program using GCC:

g++ hello.cpp -o hello

./hello

- Install GTK2

sudo apt-get install pkg-config
sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev libgtk-3-dev


- Install "wmctrl"
  (Needed for progress bars on LINUX)
  sudo apt install wmctrl 

  
Raspberry Pi 5:
---------------

The following description refers to the Pi with an SSD installed.
The operating system should be installed there
and booted from there.

Installation is also done in the same
way as for the Raspberry Pi 4,
except that the following additional
instructions must be noted:


- Insert the included SD card into the
  included adapter, then plug it into
  a free USB port.
  After powering on, it will boot from there
  and the installation routine will start.
  However, a network cable must be connected to the
  router first, as selecting
  a Wi-Fi network will only allowed later.
- Before you are prompted to reboot,
  unplug the USB SD adapter so that the
  operating system boots from the SSD.
- During installation, you can alternatively select
  Firefox as the default browser.
- The easy-to-use "Text Edit" from the Pi 4
  is no longer available here. Alternatively, you can install
  "Gedit":
  sudo apt install gedit
  There are other text editors,
  suggestions can be found online.
- The "pcre" library is missing, which can be installed as follows:
  sudo apt install libpcre3 libpcre3-dev
  This should allow all HWGUI programs to be built. 

  

3. Install Harbour
------------------

- Create the installation destination with the
  file explorer manually:
  /home/afu/Harbour

  
- Download the Harbour code snapshot from github.io.
  (Browser is named "Chromium")

- Extract it with the Archiver to
  /home/afu/Harbour/core-master

- Go to this directory and start the build process by typing
  make
  (this needs some time)  


4. Install HWGUI
----------------

- Edit the .profile:
  Open the file viewer and allow to show
  hidden files.
  Goto to .profile and and right click:
  Open with "Text Editor":

# --- Harbour and HWGUI --
   HARBOUR_INSTALL=/home/afu/Harbour/core-master
   HWGUI_INSTALL=$HOME/hwgui
   PATH=$PATH:$HARBOUR_INSTALL/bin/linux/gcc:$HWGUI_INSTALL/bin
   export PATH
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$HARBOUR_INSTALL/lib/linux/gcc
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   HB_COMPILER=gcc
   export HB_COMPILER
   HB_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HARBOUR_INSTALL
   export HB_INSTALL_PREFIX
#
 
==> Set "afu" to your userid.

- Logout and login for making this entries active.

If the menu items cannot be accessed due to
insufficient screen size, you can use the
following commands to perform these actions:
 
  Restart:
  sudo reboot
  
  Immediate shutdown:
  sudo shutdown -h now


- Check for Harbour make utility:
  hbmk2 --version
  Harbour Make (hbmk2) 3.2.0dev (r2024-12-04 14:25)
  Copyright (c) 1999-present, Viktor Szakats
  https://github.com/harbour/core/
  
- Download the recent code snapshot of HWGUI
  in the "Code" tab.

- - Create the installation destination with the
  file explorer manually:
  /home/afu/hwgui
  (concerning to the settings in .profile,
   this is the base directory of HWGUI )
  
 
- Extract the HWGUI archive

- chmod 755 *.sh

- Handle missing sys/io.h
  ./missingioh.sh

- Go to base directory and start the build:
  ./make_gtk.sh -hb  
  and check afterwards for created HWGUI libraries

- Compile and run the sample demo program.
  cd samples
  hbmk2 allhbp.hbp
 
- At final, build your own HWGUI application


- Install ZBar from package or by compiling from source code 
  following the instructions in file
  contrib/qrcode/qrdecode/ReadMe.txt


We recommend to clone the SD card to get a
backup copy of the system.
Find instructions by searching in the Internet.

If the window is to big, the following hotkeys can be used for:

Close an application : Alt + F4
Shutdown : Ctrl+Alt+Del
