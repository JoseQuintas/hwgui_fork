1. Preface
----------

The Raspberry OS bases on LINUX, so
the installation is simular to
the HWGUI installation on LINUX.


2. Installation of prerequisites
--------------------------------

This chapter describes the installation of:
- The OS
- GCC
- GTK2
- wmctrl

First after switching the Raspberry Pi on,
follow the installation steps
in the Raspberry Pi desktop.
(Set language, set password of main user, 
connect to LAN/WLAN, download and run first updates, final reboot )

You need to enter a main userid (administrator role)
and an associated password. For example (in my case)
it is "afu".

Terminal:
Open a terminal window on your Raspberry Pi
(you can do this by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T)
and run the commands.


Now start the full upgrade:

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y

This takes some time.


sudo apt install build-essential -y


Check the GCC by typing:
gcc --version
gcc (Rasbian 10.2.1-6+rpi1) 10.2.1 20210110 

nano hello.cpp

#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
  return 0;
}

Save and exit the editor (in nano, press Ctrl+X, then Y to save and Enter to confirm the filename). Now compile the program using GCC:

g++ hello.cpp -o hello

./hello

- Install GTK2

sudo apt-get install pkg-config
sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev libgtk-3-dev


- Install "wmctrl"
  (Needed for progress bars on LINUX)
  sudo apt install wmctrl 


3. Install Harbour
------------------

- Create the installation destination with the
  file explorer manually:
  /home/afu/Harbour

  
- Download the Harbour code snapshot from github.io.
  (Browser is named "Chromium")

- Extract it with the Archiver to
  /home/afu/Harbour/core-master

- Go to this directory and start the build process by typing
  make
  (this needs some time)  


4. Install HWGUI
----------------

- Edit the .profile:
  Open the file viewer and allow to show
  hidden files.
  Goto to .profile and and right click:
  Open with "Text Editor":

# --- Harbour and HWGUI --
   HARBOUR_INSTALL=/home/afu/Harbour/core-master
   HWGUI_INSTALL=$HOME/hwgui
   PATH=$PATH:$HARBOUR_INSTALL/bin/linux/gcc:$HWGUI_INSTALL/bin
   export PATH
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$HARBOUR_INSTALL/lib/linux/gcc
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   HB_COMPILER=gcc
   export HB_COMPILER
   HB_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HARBOUR_INSTALL
   export HB_INSTALL_PREFIX
#
 
==> Set "afu" to your userid.

- Logout and login for making this entries active.

- Check for Harbour make utility:
  hbmk2 --version
  Harbour Make (hbmk2) 3.2.0dev (r2024-12-04 14:25)
  Copyright (c) 1999-present, Viktor Szakats
  https://github.com/harbour/core/
  
- Download the recent code snapshot of HWGUI
  in the "Code" tab.

- - Create the installation destination with the
  file explorer manually:
  /home/afu/hwgui
  (concerning to the settings in .profile,
   this is the base directory of HWGUI )
  
 
- Extract the HWGUI archive

- chmod 755 *.sh

- Handle missing sys/io.h
  ./missingioh.sh

- Go to base directory and start the build:
  ./make_gtk.sh   
  and check afterwards for created HWGUI libraries

- Compile and run the sample demo program.
  cd samples
  hbmk2 allhbp.hbp
 
- At final, build your own HWGUI application


We recommend to clone the SD card to get a
backup copy of the system.
Find instructions by searching in the Internet.

If the window is to big, the following hotkeys can be used for:

Close an application : Alt + F4
Shutdown : Ctrl+Alt+Del
