 Special instructions for migration of HWGUI from GTK2 to GTK3

0.) Preface

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
! The migration of HWGUI to GTK3 is under construction !
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It is very hard to migrate a GTK2 application to GTK3, because
lots of old functions are removed.
In most cases these are functions for drawing.
The must be substituted by usage of the cairo graphic function library.

The design of dialog elements differ very significant.
For example, the size of buttons need more space.

Scripts and makefiles to build HWGUI and programs
are ready to use.

So all sample programs must be tested step by step.

At this time it is recommended, to use GTK2, if your
OS supports it !


1.) Additional instructions for developers of HWGUI applications

The migration must be done carefully "Step by Step".
So be patient, if all sample programs for GTK2 are running on
GTK3 with no trouble.

2.1) Compiling the HWGUI application

Look into a sample hbp file in directoy samples to
modify the hbc files:

{win}../hwgui.hbc
# GTK2
{linux}../hwgui.hbc
# GTK3: Deactivate previous line
# and activate following line
#{linux}../hwguiGTK3.hbc

so modify to:
# {linux}../hwgui.hbc
 ...
{linux}../hwguiGTK3.hbc

2.2) Compiler switches

Use these compiler switches to make code for
GTK2 and GTK3:

C files:


#if GTK_MAJOR_VERSION -0 < 3
   /* GTK2 */
   ...
#else
   /* GTK3 */
   ...
#endif

or


#if ! ( GTK_MAJOR_VERSION -0 < 3 )
   /* GTK3 */
   ...
#endif

PRG files:

#ifdef ___GTK3___
   * GTK3
   ...
#else
   * GTK2
   ...
#endif

or

#ifdef ___GTK3___
   * GTK2
   ...
#endif


2.) Run the application with GTK3

Ignore this message at start displayed in the terminal window:
Gtk-CRITICAL : New application windows must be added after the GApplication::startup signal has been emitted.

Other messages, but have no effect on function:
gtk_container_propagate_draw: assertion '_gtk_widget_get_parent (child) == GTK_WIDGET (container)' failed


3.) TO-DO list and list of problems to solve

- INIT DIALOG crashes with access violation if background image is set.
  ==> How to set a background image with CAIRO ?
- How to display an icon (see test/icon.c)
- Check all samples for GTK3, only those running on GTK2.


4.) To be modified in the appliation by the programs:

- Design troubles:
  Buttons need more space, see sample program demofunc.prg.
  It seems, that FONT and SIZE options are ignored and the
  size is rendered by CAPTION string.
  Also the underline character "_" is omitted.

- Lot's of messages displayed in the terminal running the program, for example:
  Gtk-CRITICAL **: 08:01:20.521: gtk_container_propagate_draw: assertion '_gtk_widget_get_parent (child) == GTK_WIDGET (container)' failed

- BROWSE: The Move() function has no effect to increase the browse window with increasing
  the main window manually (dbview.prg).

- The task bar overlappes the menu,so overalpped menu item are not reachable (dbview.prg).

- The menu needs about 25 pixels, so start for example the BROWSE at y = 25 + 1.
  Also other y positions of following dialog elements must increase the vertical position
  for 25 pixels (dbview.prg).


5.) Miscanellous

- Quick change between GTK2 and GTK3 for developing and test (example session):
   ./clean.sh
   ./make_gtk.sh -hb   ==> GTK2
   cd samples
   ==> edit dbview.hbp for GTK2
   hbmk2 dbview.hbp
   ./dbview
   cd ..
   ./clean.sh
   ./make_gtk3.sh  ==> GTK3
   cd samples
   ==> edit dbview.hbp for GTK3
   hbmk2 dbview.hbp
   ./dbview
   ...
